SyncPDFViewer
=============

Works in several iPads.Once an iPad open the app,it will connect to any other iPad which is using the same app and in the same network segment too.One iPad can be the host to read PDF file,while other iPads will show the same content at same page with the host.Be sure they have the same PDF files in the Document folder.PS:The PDF shows in the UIPageViewController so that the page transition style is like the iBook.
